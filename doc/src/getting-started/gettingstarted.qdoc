    \title Getting Started with Qt
    \brief A quick guide for developers


    This guide shows how to get started developing with Qt.

    \section1 Get and install Qt

    The installation process is straightforward. The Qt Online Installer
    gives you the choice of installing only the modules and tools you need.

    \section2 1. Create a Qt Account

    To begin, create a \l{Qt Account}. This account gives
    you access to a web portal to manage your licenses and access to the forums
    and wikis. Also, make sure you read the \l{Qt Licensing} page regarding your
    chosen license.

    \section2 2. Download the Installer

    Download the installer from the \l {Qt Downloads}{Downloads} page. With
    the \e{Qt Online Installer}, you can install both commercial or open
    source versions of Qt, development tools, and other components. The online
    installer requires your \l{Qt Account}. The installer retrieves the license
    attached to the account from a server and provides a list of available
    components corresponding to the license.

    \section2 3. Install Qt

    To complete the installation, select the components that you want to install
    and follow the instructions of the installation program.

    The following YouTube video gives a complete walk-through of the
    installation process:

    \section3 Updating or Removing Components

    Once Qt is installed, you can use the \e{Maintenance Tool} under
    \e{<install_dir>} to add components, update, or remove installed
    components.

    \section1 Create Your First Applications

    Learn the basics of Qt and Qt Quick development by following the two tutorials
    below that illustrate how to create simple applications and build and run them on
    target platforms:
    \list
    \li \l {Getting Started Programming with Qt Widgets}
    \li \l {Getting Started Programming with Qt Quick}
    \endlist

    \l{Qt Widgets} provides a library of UI elements which allow you to
    create classic desktop-style user interfaces. \l {Qt Quick} is a library
    providing types and functionalities for building modern, fluid, animated
    UIs.

    For a more thorough walkthrough of the different aspects of developing
    applications with Qt, see the \l {QML Book}. It focuses on Qt Quick,
    but also provides the information needed to use QML together with C++.

    \section1 Explore Qt

    We invite you to explore the rest of Qt. We prepared overviews which help
    you decide which APIs to use and our examples demonstrate how to use them.

    To view a list of all Qt examples, visit the \l{List of Qt Examples} page.

        \endlist

    \section1 Participate in the Qt Community

    Qt's vibrant and active community site \l{http://qt.io}, houses
    a wiki, a forum, and additional learning guides and presentations.

    \section1 Getting Help
